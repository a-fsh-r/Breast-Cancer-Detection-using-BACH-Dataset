## 🎯 Multi-Class Classification of Breast Cancer Using Histopathology Images

In this project, we implemented deep learning-based methods for the accurate classification of breast cancer using histopathology images from the **BACH dataset**. 

Key contributions include:

- 📊 Leveraging the diverse BACH dataset consisting of multiple breast cancer classes to train robust models  
- 🛠️ Applying comprehensive data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting  
- 🔍 Fine-tuning state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to achieve high classification accuracy across multiple classes  
- 📈 Enhancing detection performance by optimizing training pipelines and hyperparameters
